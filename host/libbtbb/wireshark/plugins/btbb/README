BTBB Wireshark plugin

This is the Bluetooth baseband plugin for Wireshark, it also includes an LMP
level dissector.

To build this on Debian/Ubuntu/BackTrack linux distributions:
  sudo apt-get install wireshark-dev wireshark
  cd libbtbb/wireshark/plugins/btbb/
  cmake .
  make
  make install

This will install to the .wireshark/ in your home directory.  To override this
set the DESTDIR environment variable when running cmake.

To build the plugin as part of wireshark, use the following commands:
  tar xf wireshark-1.8.2.tar.bz2
  cp -R libbtbb/wireshark/plugins/btbb wireshark-1.8.2/plugins/
  patch -p0 < wireshark-1.8.2/plugins/btbb/wireshark-1.8-btbb.patch

  cd wireshark-1.8.2
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
