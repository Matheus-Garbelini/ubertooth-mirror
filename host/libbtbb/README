libbtbb
=======

This is the Bluetooth baseband decoding library, forked from the GR-Bluetooth 
project.  It can be used to extract Bluetooth packet and piconet information 
from Ubertooth devices as well as GR-Bluetooth/USRP.

This code is incomplete, it is still under active development.  Patches and 
bug reports should be sent to Dominic Spill (dominicgs@gmail.com) or 
Michael Ossmann (mike@ossmann.com).

This software has been developed and tested on Linux, it should work on other 
platforms but this has yet to be tested.
